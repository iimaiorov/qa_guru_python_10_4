# Basic Python Algorithm Testing

## Project Description

This project includes a set of simple Python tests designed to validate fundamental programming concepts and algorithms. The tests cover various tasks such as greeting message generation, geometric calculations, list operations, and dictionary creation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iimaiorov/python-basic-algorithm-tests.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-basic-algorithm-tests
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the tests using the following command:
```bash
pytest
```

## Project Structure

- **test_greeting()**: Generates and checks a greeting string.
- **test_rectangle()**: Computes the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
- **test_circle()**: Computes the area and circumference of a circle.
